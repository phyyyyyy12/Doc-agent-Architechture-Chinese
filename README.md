## 🎯 Core Value Propositions

1. **Structural Cognition**: Moving beyond simple RAG by identifying Markdown `#` header hierarchies to build deep knowledge indexes, ensuring context is never lost during retrieval.
2. **Traceable Decisions**: Utilizing an "Evolution Log" pattern to document how memory systems and token management are optimized, incorporating design philosophies from cutting-edge frameworks like Doubao Agent.
3. **Enterprise-Grade Implementation**: Specifically engineered to solve **Context Overflow** issues in long-document scenarios.

## 📂 Quick Access to Implementation (Source Code)

* `src/memory_manager.py`: Implementation of the dynamic token weight pruning algorithm.
* `src/md_parser.py`: Structured chunking logic based on header paths (Breadcrumbs).
